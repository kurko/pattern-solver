# pattern-solver

This is a project I have in my mind for a few years to develop some Goal-Oriented Programming. On my head it's all abstract and lines and graphs and patterns and I don't know how it translates to real life. I finally stopped to take some notes on interfaces and how it should work. It might make zero sense at all.
